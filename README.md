# LlamaPost

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
`LlamaPost` is a filtering and retrieval system that selects relevant posts based on user-specified criteria such as **length, language, and tags**. It is designed to help Large Language Models (LLMs) generate more contextually appropriate responses by retrieving a subset of relevant posts from a dataset.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Post Filtering:** Retrieve posts based on `length`, `language`, and `tags`.
- **UTF-8 Encoding Support:** Ensures that data is properly formatted for processing.
- **Optimized for LLaMA:** Helps prevent issues like response repetition by diversifying retrieval.
- **Customizable Retrieval Logic:** Fine-tune filters to extract better samples for few-shot learning.
